Intro

    Welcome! I'm Kyler! 

    I am a Junior Software Developer based out of Choctaw, OK learning the ropes of building (and maintaining) websites, applications, and more to come!

About

    My passion for software development started in recent years, I've a constant computer user and started to think more about what is under the hood of all these 
    applications I am constantly interacting with. I dove in head first and haven't looked back, I am taken aback by what you can accomplish on your own and can
    only imagine what I will be able to do alongside other talented individuals.

    I've always been keen for creation, almost anything I do outside of developing has some layer of creation to it!

    Outside of software development my hobbies include:
        Cooking
        Video Games
        Gardening
